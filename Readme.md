# CAPM and WACC Calculator

This is a Python function for calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) and the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which are important concepts in corporate finance used for estimating the required return on equity and the cost of capital for a company.

## Features
- Calculates the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) and the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
- Provides clear output of results
- Allows the user to input various parameters, such as total assets, total debt, interest rate on debt, corporate tax rate, beta, market risk premium, and risk-free rate.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x

## Usage

--scss
Copy code
WACC_CAPM(Total_Assets, Debt, Interest_on_Debt, Tax, Beta, Market_Premium, Risk_Free_Rate)
This will calculate the WACC and CAPM based on the inputs provided. You can modify the inputs to calculate the WACC and CAPM for different companies.
